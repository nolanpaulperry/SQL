# Nolan Perry's SQL Portfolio

## My portfolio contains data about video games, which console they were released with, the genre of game, and how much each game costs today. The data is portrayed using SQL code I wrote. Let me know if you have any questions regarding the data! My email is nolanpaulperry@gmail.com
