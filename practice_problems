-- The following SQL code is a collection of questions I've answered from various SQL practice websites.



-- List each country name where the population is larger than that of 'Russia'.

SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE population >
     (SELECT population FROM world
      WHERE name='Russia');
      
-- Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'.

SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE continent = 'Europe' AND gdp/population > (
     SELECT gdp/population
     FROM world
     WHERE name = 'United Kingdom');
   
-- List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. Order by name of the country.

SELECT name, continent
FROM world
WHERE continent IN
     (SELECT continent
     FROM world
     WHERE name IN ('Argentina', 'Australia'))
ORDER BY name;

-- Which country has a population that is more than United Kingdom but less than Germany? Show the name and the population.

SELECT name, population
FROM world
WHERE population <
  (SELECT population
  FROM world
  WHERE name = 'Germany')
AND population >
  (SELECT population
  FROM world
  WHERE name = 'United Kingdom');
  
-- Show the name and the population of each country in Europe. Show the population as a percentage of the population of Germany.

SELECT name, CONCAT(CAST(ROUND(100*population/(SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Germany'), 0) AS INT),  '%')
FROM world
WHERE continent = 'Europe';

-- Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? (Give name only.)

SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE gdp > ALL(SELECT gdp FROM world WHERE continent = 'Europe' AND gdp >0);
